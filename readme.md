# JavaScript Practise Scripts

This repo stores the JavaScript scripts that I code from codewars or elsewhere. Its particularly useful to me so I can edit and keep my progress whenever I can't access my laptop. It's public so others can see if they get stuck or how I solved, if they're curious. Each script coming from a kata will soon contain a link to its [CodeWars](codewars.com/) page. Some scripts may not be from there, so they won't have said link. All scripts have a small description in this file, starting next (in chronological order where older goes lower):
## Katas
### Sum of positive (8 kyu)
Given an array of numbers, return the sum of all positive numbers.
### Summation (7 kyu)
Return the sum of all natural numbers less than or equal to the input
### Binary addition (7 kyu)
Given two numbers, return the binary value of their sum. Conversion order is not strict.

### Take a Ten Minute Walk (6 kyu)
On a hypothetically perfectly gridded city, return true if a walk route given will take ten minutes and gets back to the starting point. Else return false.
### Hello world (8 kyu)
You won't believe it! 
\
Function must return hello world. Description said it had to be creative-
### Replace with Alphabet Position (6 kyu)
Just as before, title gives it away: all leters in a string may be replaced by their alphabetic position as a number. Said resulting numbers should be separated by whitespace. Non-letters should be ignored.

### Even or Odd (8 kyu)
As title implies, the script must tell whether the number introduced is odd or not.

### Counting duplicates (6 kyu)
Script should return the amount of alphabetic and numeric characters happening more than once in a given string. Scripter may assume that the string is only composed of alphabetic and numeric characters. Alphabetic characters count as repeated regardless of case. Note that amount of alphabetic and numeric characters that repeat â‰  amount of repetitions
